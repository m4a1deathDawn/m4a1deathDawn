### Amateur Programming Learner⌨️  
> I just start learning programming for one month, my level is limited, please give me some suggestions.  
> my current goal is learning the necessary languages so that I can write programs.  
> next I will use these languages to make some game mods and plugins.  
> + the language(s) I **already learned**: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML-red) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-purple).  
> + the language(s) I **am learning**: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-yellow).  
> + the language(s) I **will learn**: ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-blue) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-green).  
> > I start learn from HTML and CSS because they can help me create my own web pages and parse information from other web pages(by the way, CSS is so hard for me to use, I can only use CSS for simple style layout).  
> > now I'm learning JavaScript because it will help me understand the web page better and also help me understand programming languages and syntax. after learning HTML and CSS, it will make the role of code more intuitive.  
> > next I will start to learn Python because it can help me collect information from web pages(crawler) and also helps me make some plugins(I learned some Python in collage courses, but I want to start to learn it again).  
> > another language I want to learn is C#, because the development of some game mods requires C#, such as **Tmodloader**, and the development of some software plugins also requires C#, such as **TeamSpeak**.
>
> **I am learning programming by myself. learn programming from some tutorial videos on BiliBili and from freeCodeCamp website. and search for information from runoob website and the languages' offical websites.**  
> I hope I can finish learning these languages ​​as soon as possible, and be able to use them more proficiently and try to master them. I may learn more languages ​​later to meet my future goals.  
> I hope you can give me more suggestions, I will be grateful.

> sometimes I like to tinkering with computer hardware, for example, **overlock** my RAM memory, GPU core and video memory, **unlock** my laptop **CPU power limit**, and **modify cooling** of my laptop to water cooling.  
> **I'm glad to make more friends if you are interesed in, please contract with me.**
